                        <h2>A little about us</h2>
                        <p>Everything started 6 years ago (2016), it starts the history and tradition of Shisha in Shkoder-Albania with 'Primo Shisha Lounge'. The thing who made us opening a shisha bar was that it would be something new to our citizens because there was not any shisha bar. So, we created an equip and we decided to bring something new. We decided to buy the latest type of shisha which is called high-tech shisha. By adding breakfast and different cocktails in the menu our bar become more attractive for our clients and today if you don’t call us and reserve your table before coming you cannot find a place. Thanks to our clients, which made us improve our skills and perfectionated year by year, and we will be here for you...Forever!</p>

                    <p>Most of our customers ask us if we sell shisha and usually the answer it was no. Regarding this high interest of our clients to buy shisha, our staff contacted with the general manager of company where we bought our shishas to give the possibility to buy the same shisha and the same quality for our clients. They created a site which we can access easily and you can choose your preferred shisha.</p>
